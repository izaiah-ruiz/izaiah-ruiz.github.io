### CPSC 120

* lab 8

    I really enjoyed the content within lab 8. I thought the concept of coding regarding olympic scores was interesting. I also enjoyed using loops, especially nested loops, something that I have a good understanding of. 
*lab 11

    I thought lab 11 was really interesting. I liked part 2 because it was an interactive game, and I also enjoyed writing all of the code for the section where you return whether it is higher or lower than the secret number. 
*lab 12

    Lab 12 was one of my favorite labs because it was not only challenging but I thought that making gifs and animations was really interesting. I had always wondered how gifs are made, and also I thought it was interesting learning about pseudorandom numbers.
